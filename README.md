Project Description:
This independent study course focuses on how people learn computer programming languages, such as Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Traditional computer programming practice has included writing pseudocode, code-reading and tracing, and code-writing.  These problems can be time-intensive and frustrating; they can decrease students’ engagement and motivation—and not much has changed in the last decade.  In contrast to traditional programming practice, mixed-up code (Parsons) problems require learners to place code blocks in the correct order.  Parsons problems usually improve problem-solving efficiency, lower cognitive load, and most undergraduates find them useful for learning how to program.  Few programming environments offer learners the option to solve the same problem across different programming problem types. This independent study focuses on Codespec, a programming tutor that supports learners in solving a programming problem as a pseudocode Parsons problem, a Parsons problem, a Faded Parsons problem, a fix-code problem, or a write-code problem.

The learning objectives are to:


1.	Understand the foundations of conducting social and behavioral research.
2.	Obtain a clear and detailed understanding of the research design process (writing research questions and hypotheses, choosing the appropriate methods and analysis techniques, and reporting results).
3.	Understand the foundations of computing education research on learning how to program.
4.	Develop quantitative and qualitative data analysis skills.
5.	Participate in computing education, human-computer interaction, and learning science research communities.
6.	Develop programming skills relating to research and web development.
7.	Explore the research on human-computer interaction.

The tasks and deliverables include:
1.	Completing the online CITI training course on social and behavioral research.
2.	Reading past and current literature relevant to how people learn to program and writing seven article summaries.
3.	Attending a talk related to the course and writing a reflection.
4.	Performing quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis.
5.	Writing programs in Python to prepare and analyze quantitative data from Runestone Academy and Codespec.
6.	Conducting a pilot study with at least three participants.
7.	Creating discipline-specific Python programming problems.
8.	Designing a poster and submitting it to a conference such as the ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research (ICER).
9.	Or writing a short paper and submitting it to a conference.
